    - `Más vale maña que fuerza` -> `Better skill than strength` (Spain, [ref](https://www.donquijote.org/spanish-language/sayings/) )

    - `Doe maar Normaal, dan doe je al gek genoeg` -> `Act normal, as that’s crazy enough` (Netherland, [ref](https://theculturetrip.com/europe/the-netherlands/articles/7-hilarious-dutch-sayings-you-need-to-know/) )
